in addition hd209458b showed hints of silicates suggesting that the high clouds on that planet contain very fine sand like particles capturing the spectra from the two hot jupiter planets was no easy feat

nasa scientist chile earthquake may have shifted earth 's axis shortened day
thumb a scientist for nasa has said that the recent magnitude 8 8 earthquake in chile which killed at least seven hundred people may have moved the earth 's axis and caused the day to shorten
richard gross a scientist at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena california computed how the globe 's rotation should have been altered by the earthquake he and fellow scientists determined that the day had been shortened by approximately 1 26 microseconds a microsecond is one millionth of a second
--------------------------------------------------
using a complex model he and fellow scientists came up with a preliminary calculation that the quake should have shortened the length of an earth day by about 1 26 microseconds a microsecond is one millionth of a second
by comparison gross said the same model estimated the 2004 magnitude 9 1 sumatran earthquake should have shortened the length of day by 6 8 microseconds and shifted earth 's axis by 2 32 milliarcseconds about 7 centimeters or 2 76 inches
