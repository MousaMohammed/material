while i am not a believer myself there is no incompatibility between a creator and the evolutionary process it is only when you decide to take a literal interpretation of the creation fable from whichever holy book you have chosen that you have to take the extreme steps of ignoring the evidence and misinterpreting scientific theories and laws

for au 's legal team pratt 's meticulous 140 page ruling capped more than three years of hard work including extensive research and on site visits with inmates and their families in newton americans united first became interested in the case late in 2002 after a newton inmate filed a lawsuit without an attorney challenging the program and outlining its details
==========================
if the ruling stands up on appeal not only will earley 's group have to shut down the program it will be required to repay the state of iowa more than 1 5 million in public support it has received during that time the june 2 decision inwas a staggering loss not just for earley 's group but perhaps for key elements of president george w bush 's faith based initiative as well u s
==========================
innerchange now receives tax support in texas kansas and minnesota and a program that prison fellowship claims is privately funded was launched in arkansas just days before the ruling came down in addition innerchange hopes to make inroads into the federal prison system
==========================
the court 's decision makes clear that the government can not provide any support whatsoever to a program that proselytizes those it claims to serve or coerces them to take part in religious activities or discriminates against those who refuse to adopt its religious teachings luchenitser was joined on au 's litigation team by au attorney heather weaver and iowa civil rights attorney dean stowers federal lawmakers who back the bush faith based initiative are well aware that the decision spells trouble for their agenda
==========================
innerchange 's field guide clearly warns that non christians and those who desire time to observe faith practices not included in the innerchange program e g roman catholics who wish to attend mass or native americans who wish to participate in the sweat lodge ceremony may do so only if those observances do not conflict with the innerchange program requirements pratt found this reliance on conversion clear evidence of innerchange 's sectarian character to anyone well acquainted with the program as are the state dept of corrections management team and the innerchange staff the object of the innerchange program is to change inmates ' behavior through personal conversion to christianity he wrote
==========================
money from that fund is supposed to be spent on programs to benefit all prisoners yet a significant portion of it was being siphoned off to fund a religious program that only some inmates wanted au 's lawsuit challenged only state involvement with innerchange not religious programs in prisons generally
==========================
the two lawsuits were then combined into one the innerchange program was given the prison 's honor unit which had been used to house the best behaved inmates
==========================
he was not pleased the courts took god out of america 's schools now they are on the path to take god out of america 's prisons earley groused earley 's analysis of judicial decisions dealing with religion and public schools was widely off the mark but he had good reason to be upset about the recent ruling on public funds for inmate indoctrination

a few years after that the state stopped using the telephone monies instead funding the program with direct appropriations from the healthy iowans tobacco trust which is partly composed of tax dollars many inmates and their families were especially upset over the allocation from the telephone rebate program
==========================

frederick omiah a member of the kenya health professionals society said the government 's decision had set up a very ugly scenario and he feared strikers would continue protests in nairobi and elsewhere

twenty five thousand of these officers have as of this morning been deleted from the payroll all qualified health professionals who are unemployed and or retired have been advised to report to their nearest health facility for interviews and deployment starting tomorrow morning at 9 o 'clock he added

all illegally striking health professionals who defied the directive to report back to work have been sacked government spokesman alfred mutua said on thursday

meanwhile a politician has lodged a legal challenge to the talks saying they are unconstitutional and do not involve all kenyans
==========================
discussions centred on the creation of the post of prime minister likely to be taken by mr odinga
==========================
both sides agreed that there should be a prime minister but had differed on what powers the new post would have
==========================
a coalition government comprising members of the current ruling party and opposition will now be formed
==========================
the post election violence saw thousands of people targeted because they belonged to ethnic groups seen as either pro government or pro opposition
==========================
antony kirori who vied for a parliamentary seat and lost to mr odinga says any resolution would alter the country 's governance structure
==========================
his success in negotiating this deal is also very good news for other troubled areas that perhaps in mr annan africans have a trouble shooter who they can trust to help them out of their knotty post colonial handicaps

the biggest military action in kenya 's recent history comes five years after ethiopia invaded somalia with us approval and air support an action that ended in ignominious withdrawal and helped to create al shabaab in its current form
==========================
more recently the kenyan army which is trained by british and american advisers has been aiding somali militias along the border in an effort to push back the shabab who control much of southern somalia and create a buffer zone
==========================
on saturday george saitoti kenya s internal security minister announced that kenyan forces would begin hitting back even though many analysts have said that the kidnappings were not the work of the shabab but of somali bandits and pirates
==========================
al shabaab which has lost territory during the horn of africa famine and is under pressure from african union troops and rival militias in south and central somalia has not claimed responsibility for the kidnappings
==========================
the un backed transitional government which controls the capital mogadishu with the support of 9 000 african union troops said it was not consulted before kenyan forces crossed the border

*******************************************************
============================
rono kibet an opposition supporter who less than two months ago was burning down the houses of members of mr kibaki s ethnic group said we will now stop the fighting
==========================
the two were close political allies in 2002 when mr kibaki was elected president but they soon had a falling out
==========================
but the country spun into chaos on dec 30 after the national election commission declared mr kibaki the winner of a closely contested race against mr odinga who claims to have won the most votes
==========================
it s a marriage of convenience and it s the best way out because it s going to get the country moving again mr kitau said
==========================
election observers have been unanimous in saying that the results were tainted by irregularities with some saying that the government rigged the tallying of votes to give mr kibaki a slender 11th hour edge
==========================
one concern though is that this is not the first time mr kibaki 76 and mr odinga 63 have vowed to work together
==========================
one person close to the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly said that the kenyan government felt as if it had its back against the wall alfred mutua a government spokesman seemed to say as much
==========================
for the past month he has been meeting nearly every day with negotiators for mr kibaki and mr odinga searching for a political compromise
==========================
the two page power sharing agreement which came after intense international pressure and mediation by kofi annan the former united nations secretary general seemed to serve as a contract to pull kenya back from the brink
==========================
the controversy spawned bloodletting across the country with supporters of mr odinga and mr kibaki attacking one other in brutal battles

==========================
george saitoti and his deputy orwa ojode were among those who died in the crash near kenya 's capital nairobi vice president kalonzo musyoka said
==========================
the death of mr saitoti was a great tragedy that has befallen our country at this time as we are making elaborate preparations to hold peaceful elections prime minister raila odinga said at the crash scene
==========================
mr saitoti announced last year that he would seek the kenyan presidency in 2013
==========================
kenya 's government has declared three days of mourning for its internal security minister and five others killed when the police helicopter they were travelling in crashed in a forest
==========================
he was the government 's spokesman on security matters including kenya 's decision to send troops to somalia last year in which he played a key role
==========================
meanwhile an anti corruption crusader said sunday 's incident called into question the government 's procurement of planes and helicopters for its security forces
==========================
nobody knows and that 's why the experts are going to carry out investigations
==========================
police cordoned off the area as rescue crews collected the victims ' remains

==========================
africa 's longest serving leader gabon president omar bongo has given the strongest suggestion of recognising mr mugabe as president saying he was elected he took an oath and he is here with us so he is president
==========================
in a fresh sign of international disapproval of mugabe 's re election italy 's foreign ministry announced on monday that it has recalled its ambassador to zimbabwe
==========================
there are people who do n't want to talk about it despite all the western calls to try to address the subject
==========================
botswana said zimbabwe 's 27 june run off vote was so flawed by violence that it could not be considered legitimate
==========================
both zanu pf and the mdc must work together and unite the country and its peoples behind efforts to find a common solution to their national problems south africa 's foreign ministry said in a statement
==========================
we ask that they african leaders clearly state that the results of the june 27 elections in zimbabwe are illegitimate for they occurred under the cloud of targeted political violence precipitating the withdrawal of one of the two candidates the team said
==========================
but some african leaders have been openly critical of mugabe 's presence at the au talks
==========================
i would suggest not to take the soft words of the opening plenary as a reflection of the deep concern of the leaders here for the situation in zimbabwe she said
==========================
the southern african development community sadc which has been leading mediation efforts to resolve the crisis are in consultation to put a text to the summit on how to end the zimbabwe crisis notably power sharing possibilities a source close to the au 's commission said on sunday

this was the first grand slam tennis event title for kerber

*******************************************************
============================
germany 's angelique kerber stunned world number one serena williams in three sets to win her first grand slam title at the australian open
==========================
kerber had won just one of six previous matches against williams and was making her grand slam final debut but she was the better player over two hours and eight minutes on rod laver arena
==========================
kerber will rise to world number 2 and is as well placed as anyone on the evidence of today to further frustrate williams ' bid for a record equalling 22nd grand slam title
==========================
williams 34 was beaten for just the fifth time in 26 grand slam finals and the american missed the chance to tie graf 's open era record of 22 titles
==========================
kerber twice moved ahead in the decider and a stunning sixth game saw the german produce two fine drop shots and win a breathtaking 19 stroke rally to cling on to her serve and edge closer to victory
==========================
kerber who saved a match point in her first round win over misaki doi will move up to number two in the world rankings
==========================
i guess it will be fixed by the next round shrugged the 29th seed whose next opponent berdych has reached the last two semi finals at melbourne park
==========================
kerber said afterwards that being able to say she was a grand slam champion sounds crazy
==========================
kerber had to save a match point just to avoid losing in the first round and she proved her mental toughness again when the title was on the line

he was the only real candidate once the selectors decided there was only going to be one captain that was the big decision said agnew

pietersen said he would look to the senior players for advice but wanted to stamp his own captaincy style on the national team and he did not believe his own form would suffer because of the extra burden
==========================
there have been suggestions pietersen has had a strained relationship with coach moores but he insisted they would have no trouble working as a team
==========================
he was a great leader he brought me into the side and i always tried to the best i could for a great man
==========================
other potential captains whose names were in the frame were andrew strauss alastair cook and kent skipper rob key miller said in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
==========================
what a great man he was as a skipper they are huge boots to fill and i 'll try to give it the best possible go i can said the new captain

but because they wanted that starting point of a unified captain key was higher up the pecking order i think even than andrew strauss

kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future

cape verde then carved out what would prove to be the best goal scoring chance of the match with platini finding himself clean through on goal only to drag his shot badly wide when he should have done much better

perhaps for some of them the occasion was a bit too big he added

but ali moalim hassan a town elder told the afp news agency that control of the town had been effectively ceded to al shabab after the other islamist militia backing the government deserted their positions
==========================
in essence the capture of jowhar which was one of the last strongholds of the president means the government is quickly losing ground in the battle for somalia and it is also virtually surrounded by al shabab militias who have been strengthening and consolidating their hold
==========================
one resident told the reuters news agency that there had been serious fighting in jowhar in which at least seven people had been killed
==========================
more than 100 people were killed and at least 30 000 displaced in the clashes that started on may 7 the government control part of mogadishu and the border town of el berde while allied militias control areas in central somalia however al shabab which has vowed to topple ahmed controls much of the south of the country the un security council has voiced concern about reported arms supplies to al shabab by neighbouring eritrea eritrea rejects the accusations that it sends weapons to the al qaeda linked groups fighting somalia 's government the council expressed concern at the loss of life and the worsening humanitarian situation arising out of the renewed fighting

one resident told reuters that there had been serious fighting in which at least seven people had been killed

khomeini 's success in establishing the islamic republic in iran and initiating the awakening movement among muslim nations had led the us to take actions to rein in this movement through passive positions khamenei said

iran s policy of not negotiating and having relations with america remains the same until the policies of this arrogant government change said khamenei who has the final say in all matters of state under iran s system of clerical rule

the talks would not mean a breakthrough between the two foes as iran would merely use the talks with u s diplomats to remind washington of its occupiers ' duty in the conflict torn iraq state run television quoted khamenei as saying

*******************************************************
============================
a cbs news vice president linda mason said today that ms dozier was in great spirits and talking animatedly as she was brought aboard the plane for the eight hour flight to the united states
==========================
ms dozier was badly wounded in baghdad on may 29 by a car bomb as she was working on a report about american forces in iraq on memorial day
==========================
on june 6 dozier flew back to the united states on a medical transport plane and is now being treated at bethesda naval hospital near washington after initial treatment at a field hospital in iraq and then a u s military hospital in germany
==========================
dozier has been a cbs news correspondent reporting from iraq for the past three years
==========================
the image shown earlier today was remarkably different from the one cbs aired a week ago when ms dozier was shown immobile and hooked up to a respirator on her stretcher the monitors and medical machines attached to its sides nearly blocking a view of her as she was unloaded from a plane from iraq and wheeled into the landstuhl regional medical center in germany
==========================
ms dozier who has reported for the network from iraq for three years was initially treated at the american military hospital in the green zone in baghdad and has had surgery on her legs and to remove shrapnel from her skull
==========================
monday 500 of paul douglas ' friends and family joined together in bedford england to say goodbye
==========================
he said that it would be difficult to put a timeline on her recovery and rehabilitation but added that it may take many months for ms dozier to get back to full speed

the briton 22 went into the tyre wall at the ' schumacher s ' bend and struggled to get out of his mclaren before medical assistance arrived
==========================
he will undergo a final check up by fia doctor gary hartstein on sunday
==========================
hamilton ploughed into the tyres at an estimated 150mph and slumped to the gravel when he tried to get out of the car
==========================
we are not quite sure what failed but in fact it was quite fortunate because the same gun was used on fernando alonso 's car and he had n't started to lean on it yet
==========================
hamilton was kept at the circuit 's medical centre and was then taken to a military hospital near koblenz
==========================
follow live coverage of the race which starts at 1300 bst this sunday on the bbc sport website and radio five live
==========================
hamilton was in fifth before the crash but will start from 10th place on the grid if he is passed fit to race

mclaren team boss ron dennis said there is no medical reason why he ca n't race

============================
the spaniard opted to travel to spa instead of attending the ' spygate ' hearing in paris where mclaren were handed a 50m fine and stripped of their constructors ' points
==========================
it 's not over but it 's getting close said hamilton
==========================
i 'm not too bothered about ferrari i think they 're out of the picture
==========================
for me it 's about beating fernando
==========================
they did n't touch
==========================
raikkonen is now 13 points behind hamilton with a maximum of 30 available leaving the title race finely poised
==========================
he challenged david coulthard 's red bull and ran ahead of jarno trulli 's toyota in the first part of the race
==========================
raikkonen led from start to finish to head felipe massa in a ferrari one two
==========================
i do n't have a position on fairness

==========================
*******************************************************

it was ferrari who catched the constructors ' championship at belgian grand prix from mclaren team and now ended their drivers domination

*******************************************************
============================
finn raikkonen who has won two more races than anyone else this season won the championship with 110 points with alonso and hamilton tied on 109 points
==========================
the spaniard was never in contention for victory in a race that was dominated by the ferraris
==========================
his team mate fernando alonso 's hopes were dashed as he finished third behind raikkonen and the finn 's ferrari team mate felipe massa
==========================
alonso 's hold on the title he has held for two years ended in a damp squib
==========================
problems with his mclaren put hamilton to the back of the field early on
==========================
hamilton ended the season in second place on countback with one more second place race finish than alonso
==========================
i got a good start and was side by side with felipe said raikkonen
==========================
as massa eased into the lead from pole position the englishman was slow away from his second place on the grid and was passed by raikkonen before the first corner
==========================
hamilton then unwisely and unnecessarily tried to re pass his team mate on the outside into the subida da lago corner at the end of the back straight
==========================
in itself that error was not enough to end hamilton 's hopes of becoming champion but worse was soon to come

according to the country 's election system a candidate must win at least fifty percent of the popular vote to avoid a run off election

*******************************************************
============================
president karzai who was installed as afghanistan s interim president in 2001 and went on to win the country s first ever presidential ballot in 2004 needs to capture more than 50 per cent of the votes to secure an outright first round win and another five years in power
==========================
opinion polls in the run up to last thursday s vote had predicted that mr abdullah had a strong chance of forcing a run off vote
==========================
however some observers say this is almost impossible given that many women were disenfranchised as there were not enough female election staff to carry out the pre vote security checks and that turnout in the south was very low because of the taliban s threat to exact revenge on anyone who voted
==========================
european union monitors were quick to call the vote good and fair a move criticised by others as premature since election results had yet to be released
==========================
under afghanistan 's election system a presidential candidate must win over 50 per cent of the vote
==========================
the contest was thought to have come down to karzai and abdullah both of whom initially claimed victory and in recent days have begun preparing for a possible runoff likely to be held in october
==========================
mr kippen stressed that it is not yet known how many votes were involved nor whether there was a critical mass that could affect the outcome of the election
==========================
bays said most people are saying that if the election is n't rigged if there is n't fraud then it is likely that there could well be a second round
==========================
most of the vote rigging claims are concentrated in the southern pashtun belt a must win area for mr karzai where turnout was reported to be as low as 10 percent
==========================
despite the allegations of vote rigging and attacks on election day that left at least 26 people dead afghan and western officials were relieved that taliban fighters did not succeed in their threat to derail the elections
==========================

==========================
the englishman 22 had already lost the lead to raikkonen and was being pressured by alonso when he made his error
==========================
however once he had cemented his position alonso began to carve into raikkonen 's lead cutting it from more than 15 seconds to eight within eight laps before the ferrari driver responded to stabilise the gap
==========================
raikkonen won from the spaniard and they will stage a title showdown with hamilton at the final race in brazil
==========================
toro rosso 's sebastian vettel finished fourth ahead of honda 's jenson button after both drove superbly in the difficult conditions to take their best results of the season
==========================
raikkonen also boosted his title chances his win leaves him seven points behind hamilton going into the brazilian grand prix on 22 october
==========================
frenchman alain prost went on to win the race and claim the second of his four drivers ' crowns
==========================
the 22 year old had a lead of more than eight seconds when he made his first pit stop on lap 15 of the 56 lap race

crown prince taufa 'ahau tupou v the king 's eldest son was sworn in on monday september 11 as the next king but his formal coronation is likely to be next year

*******************************************************
============================
prince tu 'ipelehake a nephew of king taufa 'ahau tupou iv was the leading reformist in the tongan royal family
==========================
tonga is the last monarchy in the pacific and most of its politicians are appointed by the 88 year old king rather than elected
==========================
new zealand foreign minister winston peters described the deaths as a tragedy and praised prince tu 'ipelehake 's efforts at reform
==========================
two members of tonga 's royal family have been killed in a car crash during a visit to the united states
==========================
prince tu 'ipelehake had been scheduled to speak to tongans in san bruno california on thursday before visiting tongan communities in other parts of the us
==========================
prince tu 'ipelehake princess kaimana and their driver died when a teenager crashed her car into their vehicle
==========================
ms delgado 's car slammed into the driver 's side of the suv causing it to swerve across several lanes before tumbling to a stop on its roof

it has a population of 108 000 and its economy is dependent on pumpkin and vanilla exports fishing foreign aid and remittances from tongans living abroad

police said edith delgado 18 was racing her car on the highway when she tried to overtake the sports utility vehicle carrying the royal couple

the accident happened on wednesday in menlo park about 50 kilometres 30 miles south of san francisco

protests like this have resulted in increased pressure being placed on the monarchy to embrace democracy

*******************************************************
============================
it will contribute significantly to the peace and welfare of this country and reduce the agitation and concern people have held for a long time over this issue of reform and change he said
==========================
the palace had long pledged democratic reforms but progress has been slow and public dissatisfaction was growing correspondents say
==========================
under the proposed reforms the monocle wearing monarch 60 who insists on using the royal we and is regarded by many of his subjects as arrogant and out of touch will relinquish his role in day to day government affairs
==========================
in the tonga of his reign there will be no turning back from modernisation renewal and democracy
==========================
but his coronation had to be delayed because of pro democracy protests which culminated in riots and the burning down of much of the centre of the ramshackle capital nuku 'alofa
==========================
the constitutional reforms are likely to be enacted in time for national elections in 2010 which will be held under a revised voting system in which ordinary tongans will elect the majority of mps
==========================
the sovereign of the only polynesian kingdom is voluntarily surrendering his powers to meet the democratic aspirations of many of his people he said
==========================
if the oxford and sandhurst educated king is true to his word the reforms will bring an end to tonga 's status as one of the few countries in the world where the monarch almost single handedly runs day to day government
==========================
but pressure for change has been building in the south pacific nation

noons won the elitexc lightweight championship on november 10 2007 after the fight was stopped in the first round due to a cut over the eye of then champion nick diaz

*******************************************************
============================
noons tenure with elitexc says the 160 pound champion at least one of those demands found its way into the public forum last week when an elitexc employee reported to the media that noons had been given a 24 hour deadline to accept a rematch with nick diaz for an oct 4 live broadcast on cbs noons and his manager mark dion had been negotiating a new pay scale for the bout for over a month and talks had reached a stalemate
==========================
it was either take this fight or nothing noons signed a new agreement in may but a clause was added that forbid the promotion from speaking directly with the fighter regarding negotiations noons impressively defended his title in front of his hometown honolulu crowd last june with a 48 second knockout of the more seasoned yves edwards 34 14 1 though he says the treatment he s received as elitexc s champion from being denied extra event tickets for relatives to getting passed over for marketing opportunities has been less than encouraging in july pro elite presented noons manager dion with the diaz rematch after an in cage tussle at the hawaii event between the two fighters sent interest in the bout skyrocketing
==========================
diaz received 60 000 for his third round bashing of thomas denny on july 26 in stockton calif a lot has changed since noons joined the pro elite stable in early 2007 eighteen months ago noons 7 2 was a hot prospect for the debuting promotion touted by former elitexc live events president gary shaw as a double threat
==========================
but now the 25 year old fighter s courage and heart were suddenly thrust into question with the deadline come and gone noons will not be defending his title against diaz on oct 4
==========================
but good will quickly began to unravel following noons inaugural run in the elitexc cage against charles krazy horse bennett in february 2007 i think the relationship kind of went sour when i fought krazy horse and i lost says noons
==========================
jeremy lappen elitexc s head of fight operations said last week the promotion was undecided on the promotion s next course of action with its wayward champion noons seems to have already made up his mind though i can guarantee you that for mma i won t be sitting on the sidelines he says
==========================
with shaw a family friend and dual promoter noons believes ulterior motives were afoot in the matchmaking process why would you put your friend s son on a main event against someone that you didn t think you could build him up against asks noons despite stopping berto in the third round with a blunt knee noons doubt in pro elite led him and his manager dion to request a non title fight against diaz for their november 2007 encounter in the hopes of hitting the free market afterward on the third and final bout of his contract noons says elitexc was eager to re sign him beforehand but only if he d fight diaz for a newly created 160 pound title
==========================
but you have to pay for something you want to see noons is not afraid to admit that his compensation was at the root of the breakdown between his reps and pro elite the struggling parent company of elitexc shoxc and a handful of other promotions scattered throughout the world it is about the money and how they were paying somebody i already beat three times more says noons the san diego resident says he s made approximately 83 000 in two years and four fights
==========================
it became all about krazy horse which is fine because he won but it was nothing on me noons who was surprisingly knocked out in the first round requested a rematch with the gold toothed bennett but said the promotion turned him down
==========================
meanwhile shaw who was downsized to the role of consultant for elitexc in june has yet to deliver on three of the four boxing matches he promised noons in his contract says the fighter what course this impasse takes in the next few weeks or months is not certain

==========================
those ldp members who voted against the postal bill are said to be angry that mr koizumi has called for an election rather than offering his resignation
==========================
the move follows the defeat in the upper house of his landmark proposals to reform the country 's postal system
==========================
proponents of the reforms say they are urgently needed to put the postal service 's massive deposits into the hands of private investors and provide an impetus to the economy
==========================
but the plans had been opposed by many who feared they would lead to a poorer postal services
