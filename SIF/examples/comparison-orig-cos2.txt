==========================
the government is clear that creationism and intelligent design are not part of the science national curriculum programmes of study and should not be taught as science

the government has announced that it will publish guidance for schools on how creationism and intelligent design relate to science teaching and has reiterated that it sees no place for either on the science curriculum

responding to a petition on the number 10 epetitions site the government said the government is aware that a number of concerns have been raised in the media and elsewhere as to whether creationism and intelligent design have a place in science lessons
==========================
i have never seen a satisfactory explanation of how naturalistic evolution overcomes this fundamental law of science
==========================
it has also defined intelligent design the idea that life is too complex to have arisen without the guiding hand of a greater intelligence as a religion along with creationism
==========================
while i am not a believer myself there is no incompatibility between a creator and the evolutionary process it is only when you decide to take a literal interpretation of the creation fable from whichever holy book you have chosen that you have to take the extreme steps of ignoring the evidence and misinterpreting scientific theories and laws

intelligent design advocates are bringing significant issues to the table and science is not well served by others walking away and treating the issue as an exercise in polemics

for au 's legal team pratt 's meticulous 140 page ruling capped more than three years of hard work including extensive research and on site visits with inmates and their families in newton americans united first became interested in the case late in 2002 after a newton inmate filed a lawsuit without an attorney challenging the program and outlining its details
==========================
if the ruling stands up on appeal not only will earley 's group have to shut down the program it will be required to repay the state of iowa more than 1 5 million in public support it has received during that time the june 2 decision inwas a staggering loss not just for earley 's group but perhaps for key elements of president george w bush 's faith based initiative as well u s
==========================
innerchange now receives tax support in texas kansas and minnesota and a program that prison fellowship claims is privately funded was launched in arkansas just days before the ruling came down in addition innerchange hopes to make inroads into the federal prison system
==========================
money from that fund is supposed to be spent on programs to benefit all prisoners yet a significant portion of it was being siphoned off to fund a religious program that only some inmates wanted au 's lawsuit challenged only state involvement with innerchange not religious programs in prisons generally
==========================
a few years after that the state stopped using the telephone monies instead funding the program with direct appropriations from the healthy iowans tobacco trust which is partly composed of tax dollars many inmates and their families were especially upset over the allocation from the telephone rebate program
==========================
the court 's decision makes clear that the government can not provide any support whatsoever to a program that proselytizes those it claims to serve or coerces them to take part in religious activities or discriminates against those who refuse to adopt its religious teachings luchenitser was joined on au 's litigation team by au attorney heather weaver and iowa civil rights attorney dean stowers federal lawmakers who back the bush faith based initiative are well aware that the decision spells trouble for their agenda
==========================
the ruling in the iowa lawsuit au attorneys say will help them make the case the justice department 's interest in faith based rehabilitation is n't surprising
==========================
there are no adequate safeguards present nor could there be to ensure that state funds are not being directly spent to indoctrinate iowa inmates attorneys at americans united were especially gratified by the legal victory
==========================
innerchange 's field guide clearly warns that non christians and those who desire time to observe faith practices not included in the innerchange program e g roman catholics who wish to attend mass or native americans who wish to participate in the sweat lodge ceremony may do so only if those observances do not conflict with the innerchange program requirements pratt found this reliance on conversion clear evidence of innerchange 's sectarian character to anyone well acquainted with the program as are the state dept of corrections management team and the innerchange staff the object of the innerchange program is to change inmates ' behavior through personal conversion to christianity he wrote
==========================
innerchange inmates had extra contact with their family members and even gathered together to watch movies on weekends but innerchange inmates got an even bigger benefit access to special classes that made parole much more likely

at a ceremony in nairobi yesterday the two men put their signatures to a power sharing deal brokered by ex un head kofi annan
==========================
discussions centred on the creation of the post of prime minister likely to be taken by mr odinga
==========================
meanwhile a politician has lodged a legal challenge to the talks saying they are unconstitutional and do not involve all kenyans
==========================
negotiations between the government and mr odinga 's orange democratic movement odm lasted more than a month stalling several times
==========================
both sides agreed that there should be a prime minister but had differed on what powers the new post would have
==========================
a coalition government comprising members of the current ruling party and opposition will now be formed
==========================
the post election violence saw thousands of people targeted because they belonged to ethnic groups seen as either pro government or pro opposition
==========================
antony kirori who vied for a parliamentary seat and lost to mr odinga says any resolution would alter the country 's governance structure

==========================
mr kibaki claimed victory in the 27 december election but mr odinga said the poll was rigged
==========================
at least 1 500 people have been killed in ethnic and political violence since the disputed election police say

negotiators for kibaki and odinga had agreed in principle to create a new prime minister 's post for the opposition but they failed to agree over just how much power such a post would carry

==========================
al shabaab which has lost territory during the horn of africa famine and is under pressure from african union troops and rival militias in south and central somalia has not claimed responsibility for the kidnappings
==========================
the biggest military action in kenya 's recent history comes five years after ethiopia invaded somalia with us approval and air support an action that ended in ignominious withdrawal and helped to create al shabaab in its current form
==========================
more recently the kenyan army which is trained by british and american advisers has been aiding somali militias along the border in an effort to push back the shabab who control much of southern somalia and create a buffer zone
==========================
on saturday george saitoti kenya s internal security minister announced that kenyan forces would begin hitting back even though many analysts have said that the kidnappings were not the work of the shabab but of somali bandits and pirates

*******************************************************
============================
rono kibet an opposition supporter who less than two months ago was burning down the houses of members of mr kibaki s ethnic group said we will now stop the fighting
==========================
the two were close political allies in 2002 when mr kibaki was elected president but they soon had a falling out
==========================
but the country spun into chaos on dec 30 after the national election commission declared mr kibaki the winner of a closely contested race against mr odinga who claims to have won the most votes
==========================
election observers have been unanimous in saying that the results were tainted by irregularities with some saying that the government rigged the tallying of votes to give mr kibaki a slender 11th hour edge
==========================
one person close to the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly said that the kenyan government felt as if it had its back against the wall alfred mutua a government spokesman seemed to say as much
==========================
for the past month he has been meeting nearly every day with negotiators for mr kibaki and mr odinga searching for a political compromise
==========================
it s a marriage of convenience and it s the best way out because it s going to get the country moving again mr kitau said
==========================
the two page power sharing agreement which came after intense international pressure and mediation by kofi annan the former united nations secretary general seemed to serve as a contract to pull kenya back from the brink
==========================
it appears that the kenyan government reluctant at first to cede any substantial power finally gave in after american officials among others insisted on real power sharing and threatened to punish anyone who blocked a deal
==========================
the controversy spawned bloodletting across the country with supporters of mr odinga and mr kibaki attacking one other in brutal battles

this was the first grand slam tennis event title for kerber

*******************************************************
============================
germany 's angelique kerber stunned world number one serena williams in three sets to win her first grand slam title at the australian open
==========================
kerber had won just one of six previous matches against williams and was making her grand slam final debut but she was the better player over two hours and eight minutes on rod laver arena
==========================
kerber said afterwards that being able to say she was a grand slam champion sounds crazy
==========================
defending champions novak djokovic and serena williams cruised into the australian open third round but sixth seed petra kvitova was knocked out
==========================
kerber twice moved ahead in the decider and a stunning sixth game saw the german produce two fine drop shots and win a breathtaking 19 stroke rally to cling on to her serve and edge closer to victory
==========================
williams 34 was beaten for just the fifth time in 26 grand slam finals and the american missed the chance to tie graf 's open era record of 22 titles
==========================
i guess it will be fixed by the next round shrugged the 29th seed whose next opponent berdych has reached the last two semi finals at melbourne park
==========================
kerber who saved a match point in her first round win over misaki doi will move up to number two in the world rankings
==========================
kerber will rise to world number 2 and is as well placed as anyone on the evidence of today to further frustrate williams ' bid for a record equalling 22nd grand slam title
==========================
now i have beaten serena and won the championship

according to the country 's election system a candidate must win at least fifty percent of the popular vote to avoid a run off election

*******************************************************
============================
president karzai who was installed as afghanistan s interim president in 2001 and went on to win the country s first ever presidential ballot in 2004 needs to capture more than 50 per cent of the votes to secure an outright first round win and another five years in power
==========================
opinion polls in the run up to last thursday s vote had predicted that mr abdullah had a strong chance of forcing a run off vote
==========================
however some observers say this is almost impossible given that many women were disenfranchised as there were not enough female election staff to carry out the pre vote security checks and that turnout in the south was very low because of the taliban s threat to exact revenge on anyone who voted
==========================
under afghanistan 's election system a presidential candidate must win over 50 per cent of the vote
==========================
european union monitors were quick to call the vote good and fair a move criticised by others as premature since election results had yet to be released
==========================
the contest was thought to have come down to karzai and abdullah both of whom initially claimed victory and in recent days have begun preparing for a possible runoff likely to be held in october
==========================
mr kippen stressed that it is not yet known how many votes were involved nor whether there was a critical mass that could affect the outcome of the election
==========================
bays said most people are saying that if the election is n't rigged if there is n't fraud then it is likely that there could well be a second round
==========================
most of the vote rigging claims are concentrated in the southern pashtun belt a must win area for mr karzai where turnout was reported to be as low as 10 percent
==========================
despite the allegations of vote rigging and attacks on election day that left at least 26 people dead afghan and western officials were relieved that taliban fighters did not succeed in their threat to derail the elections
==========================

==========================
the spaniard finished second to kimi raikkonen 's ferrari in shanghai to move to within four points of his mclaren team mate with one race to go
==========================
the englishman 22 had already lost the lead to raikkonen and was being pressured by alonso when he made his error
==========================
raikkonen also boosted his title chances his win leaves him seven points behind hamilton going into the brazilian grand prix on 22 october
==========================
toro rosso 's sebastian vettel finished fourth ahead of honda 's jenson button after both drove superbly in the difficult conditions to take their best results of the season
==========================
however once he had cemented his position alonso began to carve into raikkonen 's lead cutting it from more than 15 seconds to eight within eight laps before the ferrari driver responded to stabilise the gap
==========================
raikkonen won from the spaniard and they will stage a title showdown with hamilton at the final race in brazil
==========================
frenchman alain prost went on to win the race and claim the second of his four drivers ' crowns
==========================
the 22 year old had a lead of more than eight seconds when he made his first pit stop on lap 15 of the 56 lap race
==========================
vettel 's result came after the novice was reprimanded for causing an accident behind the safety car in japan

crown prince taufa 'ahau tupou v the king 's eldest son was sworn in on monday september 11 as the next king but his formal coronation is likely to be next year

*******************************************************
============================
prince tu 'ipelehake a nephew of king taufa 'ahau tupou iv was the leading reformist in the tongan royal family
==========================
prince tu 'ipelehake 56 princess kaimana 46 and their driver vinisia hefa 36 were all killed
==========================
new zealand foreign minister winston peters described the deaths as a tragedy and praised prince tu 'ipelehake 's efforts at reform
==========================
prince tu 'ipelehake princess kaimana and their driver died when a teenager crashed her car into their vehicle
==========================
tonga is the last monarchy in the pacific and most of its politicians are appointed by the 88 year old king rather than elected
==========================
prince tu 'ipelehake had been scheduled to speak to tongans in san bruno california on thursday before visiting tongan communities in other parts of the us
==========================
two members of tonga 's royal family have been killed in a car crash during a visit to the united states

protests like this have resulted in increased pressure being placed on the monarchy to embrace democracy

*******************************************************
============================
the palace had long pledged democratic reforms but progress has been slow and public dissatisfaction was growing correspondents say
==========================
it will contribute significantly to the peace and welfare of this country and reduce the agitation and concern people have held for a long time over this issue of reform and change he said
==========================
under the proposed reforms the monocle wearing monarch 60 who insists on using the royal we and is regarded by many of his subjects as arrogant and out of touch will relinquish his role in day to day government affairs
==========================
but his coronation had to be delayed because of pro democracy protests which culminated in riots and the burning down of much of the centre of the ramshackle capital nuku 'alofa
==========================
in the tonga of his reign there will be no turning back from modernisation renewal and democracy
==========================
if the oxford and sandhurst educated king is true to his word the reforms will bring an end to tonga 's status as one of the few countries in the world where the monarch almost single handedly runs day to day government
==========================
the constitutional reforms are likely to be enacted in time for national elections in 2010 which will be held under a revised voting system in which ordinary tongans will elect the majority of mps
==========================
the sovereign of the only polynesian kingdom is voluntarily surrendering his powers to meet the democratic aspirations of many of his people he said
==========================
but pressure for change has been building in the south pacific nation
==========================
tonga is one of a handful of countries in the world where the monarch has a hand in the daily running of government

noons won the elitexc lightweight championship on november 10 2007 after the fight was stopped in the first round due to a cut over the eye of then champion nick diaz

*******************************************************
============================
but good will quickly began to unravel following noons inaugural run in the elitexc cage against charles krazy horse bennett in february 2007 i think the relationship kind of went sour when i fought krazy horse and i lost says noons
==========================
but now the 25 year old fighter s courage and heart were suddenly thrust into question with the deadline come and gone noons will not be defending his title against diaz on oct 4
==========================
noons tenure with elitexc says the 160 pound champion at least one of those demands found its way into the public forum last week when an elitexc employee reported to the media that noons had been given a 24 hour deadline to accept a rematch with nick diaz for an oct 4 live broadcast on cbs noons and his manager mark dion had been negotiating a new pay scale for the bout for over a month and talks had reached a stalemate
==========================
diaz received 60 000 for his third round bashing of thomas denny on july 26 in stockton calif a lot has changed since noons joined the pro elite stable in early 2007 eighteen months ago noons 7 2 was a hot prospect for the debuting promotion touted by former elitexc live events president gary shaw as a double threat
==========================
it was either take this fight or nothing noons signed a new agreement in may but a clause was added that forbid the promotion from speaking directly with the fighter regarding negotiations noons impressively defended his title in front of his hometown honolulu crowd last june with a 48 second knockout of the more seasoned yves edwards 34 14 1 though he says the treatment he s received as elitexc s champion from being denied extra event tickets for relatives to getting passed over for marketing opportunities has been less than encouraging in july pro elite presented noons manager dion with the diaz rematch after an in cage tussle at the hawaii event between the two fighters sent interest in the bout skyrocketing
==========================
with shaw a family friend and dual promoter noons believes ulterior motives were afoot in the matchmaking process why would you put your friend s son on a main event against someone that you didn t think you could build him up against asks noons despite stopping berto in the third round with a blunt knee noons doubt in pro elite led him and his manager dion to request a non title fight against diaz for their november 2007 encounter in the hopes of hitting the free market afterward on the third and final bout of his contract noons says elitexc was eager to re sign him beforehand but only if he d fight diaz for a newly created 160 pound title
==========================
jeremy lappen elitexc s head of fight operations said last week the promotion was undecided on the promotion s next course of action with its wayward champion noons seems to have already made up his mind though i can guarantee you that for mma i won t be sitting on the sidelines he says
==========================
it became all about krazy horse which is fine because he won but it was nothing on me noons who was surprisingly knocked out in the first round requested a rematch with the gold toothed bennett but said the promotion turned him down
==========================
there was an ultimatum either you fight you take this or we re not going to even fight you noons opponent edson berto was another prot g from esteemed combat sports lineage
==========================
i wanted the diaz fight but it was about little things in the contract at the time says noons

the us is facing similar charges over strikes two days earlier in another border area of afghanistan
==========================
he said that those who passed on intelligence to the us military ahead of the air strike should be tried as well as those who carried out the bombing
==========================
two days ago the red cross said that at least 250 afghan civilians had been killed or wounded in insurgent attacks or military action in the previous six days
==========================
at the time the us said that those killed were militants involved in previous mortar attacks on a nato base
==========================
the red cross said 250 people had been killed or wounded in five days of military action and militant attacks in the past week
==========================
however foreign troops have also often killed civilians leading to an erosion of support for their presence in afghanistan
==========================
we do go to great length to avoid civilian casualties she said
==========================
only a few months earlier a nato spokesman said that civilian casualties were the main issue for the nato led force to resolve
==========================
the toll included the us led air strikes and a suicide blast outside the indian embassy in kabul on monday that killed more than 40 people including two indian envoys
==========================
the un said last month that nearly 700 afghan civilians had lost their lives this year about two thirds in militant attacks and about 255 in military operations

washington cnn an incident in which u s officials refused to allow a klm royal dutch airlines 747 to fly over the united states has brought to light a potential hole in the nation 's homeland security safety net
==========================
an official with the department of homeland security said the agency is considering an emergency amendment that would require airlines to check transiting flights ' passenger manifests against the list
==========================
a dutch official told cnn the netherlands will take the matter to the european union in brussels to seek clarification about whether checks of no fly lists are required for flights transiting the united states
==========================
currently the united states requires international airlines to make certain that passengers on flights to and from the united states are not on a list of suspected terrorists
==========================
but on friday u s authorities denied permission for klm flight 685 to transit u s airspace after hearing indirectly that two passengers on the flight were on the no fly list
==========================
but klm has now begun checking its passenger lists for flights flying over the united states against the u s no fly list to avoid repeating last week 's incident
==========================
klm officials said they are under no obligation to check passengers on transiting planes against terror watch lists
==========================
koster also expressed irritation about the timing of the incident saying the united states was late in notifying klm that it would not permit the plane to transit
==========================
in the meantime the official said if the united states determines that a flight scheduled to fly over the country is carrying a passenger on the no fly list it will be prohibited from entering u s airspace
==========================
in our interpretation this was not a flight to or from the united states
