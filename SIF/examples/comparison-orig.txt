the government is clear that creationism and intelligent design are not part of the science national curriculum programmes of study and should not be taught as science
==========================
it added that it would expect teachers to be able to answer pupil 's questions about creationism intelligent design and other religious beliefs within a scientific framework
==========================
the government has announced that it will publish guidance for schools on how creationism and intelligent design relate to science teaching and has reiterated that it sees no place for either on the science curriculum
==========================
responding to a petition on the number 10 epetitions site the government said the government is aware that a number of concerns have been raised in the media and elsewhere as to whether creationism and intelligent design have a place in science lessons
==========================
it has also defined intelligent design the idea that life is too complex to have arisen without the guiding hand of a greater intelligence as a religion along with creationism
==========================
while i am not a believer myself there is no incompatibility between a creator and the evolutionary process it is only when you decide to take a literal interpretation of the creation fable from whichever holy book you have chosen that you have to take the extreme steps of ignoring the evidence and misinterpreting scientific theories and laws
==========================
he wrote creationism intelligent design are being used disingenuously to portray science the theory or evolution as being in crisis when they are not

if the ruling stands up on appeal not only will earley 's group have to shut down the program it will be required to repay the state of iowa more than 1 5 million in public support it has received during that time the june 2 decision inwas a staggering loss not just for earley 's group but perhaps for key elements of president george w bush 's faith based initiative as well u s
==========================
for au 's legal team pratt 's meticulous 140 page ruling capped more than three years of hard work including extensive research and on site visits with inmates and their families in newton americans united first became interested in the case late in 2002 after a newton inmate filed a lawsuit without an attorney challenging the program and outlining its details
==========================
innerchange now receives tax support in texas kansas and minnesota and a program that prison fellowship claims is privately funded was launched in arkansas just days before the ruling came down in addition innerchange hopes to make inroads into the federal prison system
==========================
the two lawsuits were then combined into one the innerchange program was given the prison 's honor unit which had been used to house the best behaved inmates

innerchange 's field guide clearly warns that non christians and those who desire time to observe faith practices not included in the innerchange program e g roman catholics who wish to attend mass or native americans who wish to participate in the sweat lodge ceremony may do so only if those observances do not conflict with the innerchange program requirements pratt found this reliance on conversion clear evidence of innerchange 's sectarian character to anyone well acquainted with the program as are the state dept of corrections management team and the innerchange staff the object of the innerchange program is to change inmates ' behavior through personal conversion to christianity he wrote
==========================
in the first full year the state allocated 229 950 from its inmate telephone rebate fund funds obtained from surcharges placed on calls made to and by inmates
==========================
the court 's decision makes clear that the government can not provide any support whatsoever to a program that proselytizes those it claims to serve or coerces them to take part in religious activities or discriminates against those who refuse to adopt its religious teachings luchenitser was joined on au 's litigation team by au attorney heather weaver and iowa civil rights attorney dean stowers federal lawmakers who back the bush faith based initiative are well aware that the decision spells trouble for their agenda

both sides agreed that there should be a prime minister but had differed on what powers the new post would have
==========================
kenyan president mwai kibaki and opposition leader raila odinga have signed an agreement to end the country 's post election crisis
==========================
a coalition government comprising members of the current ruling party and opposition will now be formed

==========================
the biggest military action in kenya 's recent history comes five years after ethiopia invaded somalia with us approval and air support an action that ended in ignominious withdrawal and helped to create al shabaab in its current form
==========================
more recently the kenyan army which is trained by british and american advisers has been aiding somali militias along the border in an effort to push back the shabab who control much of southern somalia and create a buffer zone
==========================
on saturday george saitoti kenya s internal security minister announced that kenyan forces would begin hitting back even though many analysts have said that the kidnappings were not the work of the shabab but of somali bandits and pirates
==========================
al shabaab which has lost territory during the horn of africa famine and is under pressure from african union troops and rival militias in south and central somalia has not claimed responsibility for the kidnappings
==========================
kenyan security forces have intervened in somalia before back in the 1960s when somalia tried to foment an uprising in the ethnic somali parts of kenya along the border

============================
rono kibet an opposition supporter who less than two months ago was burning down the houses of members of mr kibaki s ethnic group said we will now stop the fighting
==========================
the two were close political allies in 2002 when mr kibaki was elected president but they soon had a falling out
==========================
but the country spun into chaos on dec 30 after the national election commission declared mr kibaki the winner of a closely contested race against mr odinga who claims to have won the most votes
==========================
one concern though is that this is not the first time mr kibaki 76 and mr odinga 63 have vowed to work together
==========================
it s a marriage of convenience and it s the best way out because it s going to get the country moving again mr kitau said
==========================
election observers have been unanimous in saying that the results were tainted by irregularities with some saying that the government rigged the tallying of votes to give mr kibaki a slender 11th hour edge
==========================
one person close to the talks who was not authorized to speak publicly said that the kenyan government felt as if it had its back against the wall alfred mutua a government spokesman seemed to say as much
==========================
the two page power sharing agreement which came after intense international pressure and mediation by kofi annan the former united nations secretary general seemed to serve as a contract to pull kenya back from the brink
==========================
for the past month he has been meeting nearly every day with negotiators for mr kibaki and mr odinga searching for a political compromise
==========================
it appears that the kenyan government reluctant at first to cede any substantial power finally gave in after american officials among others insisted on real power sharing and threatened to punish anyone who blocked a deal

==========================
george saitoti and his deputy orwa ojode were among those who died in the crash near kenya 's capital nairobi vice president kalonzo musyoka said

==========================
there are people who do n't want to talk about it despite all the western calls to try to address the subject
==========================
botswana said zimbabwe 's 27 june run off vote was so flawed by violence that it could not be considered legitimate
==========================
but some african leaders have been openly critical of mugabe 's presence at the au talks
==========================
we ask that they african leaders clearly state that the results of the june 27 elections in zimbabwe are illegitimate for they occurred under the cloud of targeted political violence precipitating the withdrawal of one of the two candidates the team said
==========================
the southern african development community sadc which has been leading mediation efforts to resolve the crisis are in consultation to put a text to the summit on how to end the zimbabwe crisis notably power sharing possibilities a source close to the au 's commission said on sunday
==========================
i would suggest not to take the soft words of the opening plenary as a reflection of the deep concern of the leaders here for the situation in zimbabwe she said

this was the first grand slam tennis event title for kerber

*******************************************************
============================
germany 's angelique kerber stunned world number one serena williams in three sets to win her first grand slam title at the australian open
==========================
kerber had won just one of six previous matches against williams and was making her grand slam final debut but she was the better player over two hours and eight minutes on rod laver arena
==========================
kerber said afterwards that being able to say she was a grand slam champion sounds crazy
==========================
kerber twice moved ahead in the decider and a stunning sixth game saw the german produce two fine drop shots and win a breathtaking 19 stroke rally to cling on to her serve and edge closer to victory
==========================
kerber will rise to world number 2 and is as well placed as anyone on the evidence of today to further frustrate williams ' bid for a record equalling 22nd grand slam title
==========================
i guess it will be fixed by the next round shrugged the 29th seed whose next opponent berdych has reached the last two semi finals at melbourne park

kerber who saved a match point in her first round win over misaki doi will move up to number two in the world rankings

he was the only real candidate once the selectors decided there was only going to be one captain that was the big decision said agnew

pietersen said he would look to the senior players for advice but wanted to stamp his own captaincy style on the national team and he did not believe his own form would suffer because of the extra burden
==========================
there have been suggestions pietersen has had a strained relationship with coach moores but he insisted they would have no trouble working as a team
==========================
he was a great leader he brought me into the side and i always tried to the best i could for a great man
==========================
other potential captains whose names were in the frame were andrew strauss alastair cook and kent skipper rob key miller said in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
==========================
what a great man he was as a skipper they are huge boots to fill and i 'll try to give it the best possible go i can said the new captain
==========================
but because they wanted that starting point of a unified captain key was higher up the pecking order i think even than andrew strauss

kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future

militants purportedly belonging to the army of islam posted a video on the internet on 1 june showing the first pictures of the reporter in which he said he was being well treated

the bbc said it was aware of the video and was watching developments closely
==========================
if they do not meet these demands there will be no release of this prisoner but if things get worse we will get closer to god by killing this journalist

the government funded service is formally requesting proposals on how it should promote education and learning digitally without being non compliant

*******************************************************
============================
while the beeb is not admitting non compliance the trust is formally requesting new proposals for how the net should deliver its charter obligation to promote education and learning in an online environment
==========================
the trust has asked the corporation 's management to come up with fresh proposals for how the bbc should deliver its charter obligation to promote learning for school aged children
==========================
i think the next step for us now is to seek clarification about what we can do to respond to the demand for further proposals for online learning
==========================
the new program is believed to have the same budget as the suspended one
==========================
one wonders to what extent commercial companies are going to step into the gap that the bbc has left in terms of welsh language provision
==========================
the decision by the bbc trust follows a complaint from commercial online companies to the european commission that bbc jam had a negative impact on their businesses
==========================
he added as a union we believe that education should be a public service and when you start talking about the commercial online companies the alarm bells start ringing and we think ' has this been too successful '
==========================
the site was due for a market impact assessment this year but this action was suspended in the light of the new accusations
==========================
we in bbc wales are determined to play a part in that to ensure that school children in wales in both english and welsh get the best possible resource available
==========================
the trust is expecting to receive new proposals from the pubnet within the next three months about jam s replacement

kimberly dozier heading back to us

*******************************************************
============================
a cbs news vice president linda mason said today that ms dozier was in great spirits and talking animatedly as she was brought aboard the plane for the eight hour flight to the united states
==========================
ms dozier was badly wounded in baghdad on may 29 by a car bomb as she was working on a report about american forces in iraq on memorial day
==========================
on june 6 dozier flew back to the united states on a medical transport plane and is now being treated at bethesda naval hospital near washington after initial treatment at a field hospital in iraq and then a u s military hospital in germany
==========================
dozier has been a cbs news correspondent reporting from iraq for the past three years
==========================
the image shown earlier today was remarkably different from the one cbs aired a week ago when ms dozier was shown immobile and hooked up to a respirator on her stretcher the monitors and medical machines attached to its sides nearly blocking a view of her as she was unloaded from a plane from iraq and wheeled into the landstuhl regional medical center in germany
==========================
ms dozier who has reported for the network from iraq for three years was initially treated at the american military hospital in the green zone in baghdad and has had surgery on her legs and to remove shrapnel from her skull
==========================
monday 500 of paul douglas ' friends and family joined together in bedford england to say goodbye
==========================
he said that it would be difficult to put a timeline on her recovery and rehabilitation but added that it may take many months for ms dozier to get back to full speed

dozier 39 was still in critical but stable condition as she arrived at bethesda where publicity is being kept to a minimum to protect her privacy as she begins her long road to full recovery

we are not quite sure what failed but in fact it was quite fortunate because the same gun was used on fernando alonso 's car and he had n't started to lean on it yet
==========================
hamilton ploughed into the tyres at an estimated 150mph and slumped to the gravel when he tried to get out of the car

hamilton was kept at the circuit 's medical centre and was then taken to a military hospital near koblenz

============================
it 's not over but it 's getting close said hamilton
==========================
they did n't touch
==========================
the spaniard opted to travel to spa instead of attending the ' spygate ' hearing in paris where mclaren were handed a 50m fine and stripped of their constructors ' points
==========================
i 'm not too bothered about ferrari i think they 're out of the picture
==========================
for me it 's about beating fernando
==========================
raikkonen is now 13 points behind hamilton with a maximum of 30 available leaving the title race finely poised
==========================
he challenged david coulthard 's red bull and ran ahead of jarno trulli 's toyota in the first part of the race
==========================
i do n't have a position on fairness
==========================
and hamilton survived a scare when he ran off the track at the 150mph pouhon corner on the penultimate lap
==========================
i wo n't say any more he said
==========================
*******************************************************

it was ferrari who catched the constructors ' championship at belgian grand prix from mclaren team and now ended their drivers domination

*******************************************************
============================
finn raikkonen who has won two more races than anyone else this season won the championship with 110 points with alonso and hamilton tied on 109 points
==========================
the spaniard was never in contention for victory in a race that was dominated by the ferraris
==========================
his team mate fernando alonso 's hopes were dashed as he finished third behind raikkonen and the finn 's ferrari team mate felipe massa
==========================
alonso 's hold on the title he has held for two years ended in a damp squib
==========================
problems with his mclaren put hamilton to the back of the field early on
==========================
hamilton ended the season in second place on countback with one more second place race finish than alonso
==========================
in itself that error was not enough to end hamilton 's hopes of becoming champion but worse was soon to come
==========================
i got a good start and was side by side with felipe said raikkonen
==========================
hamilton did get up into the points during his third stint but once raikkonen assumed the lead after passing massa during the second pit stop period the englishman needed to finish fifth to stay ahead of the finn
==========================
hamilton then unwisely and unnecessarily tried to re pass his team mate on the outside into the subida da lago corner at the end of the back straight

according to the country 's election system a candidate must win at least fifty percent of the popular vote to avoid a run off election

*******************************************************
============================
president karzai who was installed as afghanistan s interim president in 2001 and went on to win the country s first ever presidential ballot in 2004 needs to capture more than 50 per cent of the votes to secure an outright first round win and another five years in power
==========================
opinion polls in the run up to last thursday s vote had predicted that mr abdullah had a strong chance of forcing a run off vote
==========================
however some observers say this is almost impossible given that many women were disenfranchised as there were not enough female election staff to carry out the pre vote security checks and that turnout in the south was very low because of the taliban s threat to exact revenge on anyone who voted
==========================
most of the vote rigging claims are concentrated in the southern pashtun belt a must win area for mr karzai where turnout was reported to be as low as 10 percent
==========================
european union monitors were quick to call the vote good and fair a move criticised by others as premature since election results had yet to be released
==========================
bays said most people are saying that if the election is n't rigged if there is n't fraud then it is likely that there could well be a second round
==========================
under afghanistan 's election system a presidential candidate must win over 50 per cent of the vote
==========================
the contest was thought to have come down to karzai and abdullah both of whom initially claimed victory and in recent days have begun preparing for a possible runoff likely to be held in october
==========================
mr kippen stressed that it is not yet known how many votes were involved nor whether there was a critical mass that could affect the outcome of the election
==========================
despite the allegations of vote rigging and attacks on election day that left at least 26 people dead afghan and western officials were relieved that taliban fighters did not succeed in their threat to derail the elections
==========================

this mistake became an unexpected opportunity for his rivals kimi rikknen and fernando alonso in the drivers ' championship

==========================
the spaniard finished second to kimi raikkonen 's ferrari in shanghai to move to within four points of his mclaren team mate with one race to go
==========================
the englishman 22 had already lost the lead to raikkonen and was being pressured by alonso when he made his error
==========================
raikkonen also boosted his title chances his win leaves him seven points behind hamilton going into the brazilian grand prix on 22 october
==========================
however once he had cemented his position alonso began to carve into raikkonen 's lead cutting it from more than 15 seconds to eight within eight laps before the ferrari driver responded to stabilise the gap
==========================
toro rosso 's sebastian vettel finished fourth ahead of honda 's jenson button after both drove superbly in the difficult conditions to take their best results of the season
==========================
raikkonen won from the spaniard and they will stage a title showdown with hamilton at the final race in brazil
==========================
frenchman alain prost went on to win the race and claim the second of his four drivers ' crowns
==========================
the 22 year old had a lead of more than eight seconds when he made his first pit stop on lap 15 of the 56 lap race

i 'm sorry for the team but i can still do it do n't worry said hamilton

within two years after his coronation tupou v made good on his pledge for democracy and the people of tonga were able to vote in their first popularly elected parliament

the democratic changes replaced the former feudal system where the public could only vote for nine of the 33 representatives in parliament which was dominated by a clique of nobles selected by the king who also chose the prime minister and cabinet

abdullah al hubaaishi a bahraini who was making his way to the protest camp at pearl roundabout in manama told al jazeera that there were many wounded protesters on the streets in sitra
==========================
the king of bahrain has declared a state of emergency for three months on the island following weeks of anti government protests as deadly clashes continued across the country
==========================
it comes a day after troops from neighbouring gulf states were sent to bahrain to help deal with the unrest
==========================
in the financial district of manama demonstrators have built barricades from upturned rubbish bins says the bbc 's caroline hawley in the capital and many are wearing masks to protect themselves from tear gas
==========================
our correspondent said there was not a visible presence of saudi troops on the streets in his area but clashes between protesters and bahraini security forces continued elsewhere
==========================
protesters have blocked all roads leading to the capital 's financial centre the scene of clashes on sunday that left more than 200 people wounded
==========================
some in the gulf region fear iran as a shia majority country will try to inspire or organise the anti government protesters but many analysts believe the shia majority in bahrain is simply campaigning for better civil and political rights and has no desire to be dominated by iran says the bbc 's tehran correspondent james reynolds who is based in london
==========================
the shia led opposition has said the arrival of gulf states troops the first time that any arab government has called for outside military help during the current wave of protests sweeping the region is tantamount to a declaration of war

al jazeera 's correspondent in the capital manama who we are not naming for security reasons said the declaration of a state of emergency appeared to have been deliberated upon for some time now

at least 14 demonstrators have now died around the country in the past two weeks
==========================
they are expected to meet on saturday but their initial reaction has been that the king has not gone far enough
==========================
india which holds considerable influence over its neighbour said the king 's move should now pave the way for the restoration of political stability and economic recovery
==========================
analysts say that while the alliance has remained united in opposition to the king the parties that constitute it have been bitterly divided in the past and even if they wanted to they might be unable to find an acceptable candidate for prime minister
==========================
the king has ruled directly since he sacked the government in 2005 saying politicians had failed to tackle the maoist insurgency
==========================
it was welcomed as a positive step by india the eu and the us but members of nepal 's seven party opposition alliance say the offer does not mention the formation of a constituent assembly

swazi history tells us that these two kings ruled swaziland for less than 10 years each because of their aggressive attitude towards family conflicts in the royal household
==========================
they say that she always refers to him as his majesty in front of the king
==========================
the king now has two more fianc es to look after in addition to his wives and 15 children
==========================
while some accuse him of arrogance he is always seen with a smile on his face and despite his royal position maintains the swazi custom of bowing to his elders
==========================
royal sources say that she is trying to ensure that her first born son prince lindani succeeds to the throne
==========================
he also has to battle with complex family affairs involving the seven official wives he married through swazi custom and tradition
==========================
she defied a royal tradition that the queen could not have a public job when she trained as a lawyer and is now an advocate of law at the high court
==========================
if propositioned by a man the girls were supposed to throw the tassels outside his house and his family would have to pay a fine of a cow

crown prince taufa 'ahau tupou v the king 's eldest son was sworn in on monday september 11 as the next king but his formal coronation is likely to be next year

*******************************************************
============================
prince tu 'ipelehake a nephew of king taufa 'ahau tupou iv was the leading reformist in the tongan royal family
==========================
new zealand foreign minister winston peters described the deaths as a tragedy and praised prince tu 'ipelehake 's efforts at reform
==========================
tonga is the last monarchy in the pacific and most of its politicians are appointed by the 88 year old king rather than elected
==========================
two members of tonga 's royal family have been killed in a car crash during a visit to the united states
==========================
prince tu 'ipelehake had been scheduled to speak to tongans in san bruno california on thursday before visiting tongan communities in other parts of the us
==========================
prince tu 'ipelehake princess kaimana and their driver died when a teenager crashed her car into their vehicle
==========================
police said edith delgado 18 was racing her car on the highway when she tried to overtake the sports utility vehicle carrying the royal couple
==========================
ms delgado 's car slammed into the driver 's side of the suv causing it to swerve across several lanes before tumbling to a stop on its roof
==========================
it has a population of 108 000 and its economy is dependent on pumpkin and vanilla exports fishing foreign aid and remittances from tongans living abroad
==========================
the two royals were visiting members of the tongan community in the san francisco bay area to discuss political reforms in the pacific archipelago
==========================
*******************************************************

protests like this have resulted in increased pressure being placed on the monarchy to embrace democracy

*******************************************************
============================
it will contribute significantly to the peace and welfare of this country and reduce the agitation and concern people have held for a long time over this issue of reform and change he said
==========================
the palace had long pledged democratic reforms but progress has been slow and public dissatisfaction was growing correspondents say
==========================
but his coronation had to be delayed because of pro democracy protests which culminated in riots and the burning down of much of the centre of the ramshackle capital nuku 'alofa
==========================
under the proposed reforms the monocle wearing monarch 60 who insists on using the royal we and is regarded by many of his subjects as arrogant and out of touch will relinquish his role in day to day government affairs
==========================
in the tonga of his reign there will be no turning back from modernisation renewal and democracy
==========================
the constitutional reforms are likely to be enacted in time for national elections in 2010 which will be held under a revised voting system in which ordinary tongans will elect the majority of mps
==========================
if the oxford and sandhurst educated king is true to his word the reforms will bring an end to tonga 's status as one of the few countries in the world where the monarch almost single handedly runs day to day government
==========================
tonga is one of a handful of countries in the world where the monarch has a hand in the daily running of government
==========================
the sovereign of the only polynesian kingdom is voluntarily surrendering his powers to meet the democratic aspirations of many of his people he said
==========================
the royal family has lost the traditional respect of many tongans because of some disastrous policies and a perception of unabashed venality

some countries such as the cook islands tonga and tuvalu depended on imported diesel for over 95 percent of their electricity generation while others had a strong base for renewable energy such as vanuatu 19 percent mostly from wind and samoa 40 percent from hydropower but still needed a concerted effort from the donor community to reach their potential

the kiwis are now not going to be able to qualify for the final on november 25

*******************************************************
============================
the penalty has now put new zealand 's hopes of qualifying for the november 25 final in jeopardy with the kiwis locked on zero competition points with the lions
==========================
a tri nations subcommittee met in an international phone hook up today and decided to take the drastic action of penalising the kiwis the two points they gained for beating great britain last weekend
==========================
new zealand have lost two competition points and hooker nathan fien has been barred from playing in the rest of the tri nations rugby league series after the kiwis used him in a game when he was not eligible
==========================
but they stopped short of kicking the kiwis out of the tournament
==========================
fien was cleared under the grandparents rule after forwarding what he said was a birth certificate of his new zealand born grandmother as proof of his eligibility
==========================
rugby league international federation chairman colin love said the kiwis had argued that they thought great grandparents were as good as grandparents in terms of eligiblility
==========================
fien has reportedly already left the kiwi camp and is believed to be headed back to townsville
==========================
love said he accepted that the kiwis had misinterpreted the rules and made an honest mistake
==========================
new zealand have only one more match to play against great britain in wellington on saturday week

noons won the elitexc lightweight championship on november 10 2007 after the fight was stopped in the first round due to a cut over the eye of then champion nick diaz

*******************************************************
============================
but now the 25 year old fighter s courage and heart were suddenly thrust into question with the deadline come and gone noons will not be defending his title against diaz on oct 4
==========================
noons tenure with elitexc says the 160 pound champion at least one of those demands found its way into the public forum last week when an elitexc employee reported to the media that noons had been given a 24 hour deadline to accept a rematch with nick diaz for an oct 4 live broadcast on cbs noons and his manager mark dion had been negotiating a new pay scale for the bout for over a month and talks had reached a stalemate
==========================
it was either take this fight or nothing noons signed a new agreement in may but a clause was added that forbid the promotion from speaking directly with the fighter regarding negotiations noons impressively defended his title in front of his hometown honolulu crowd last june with a 48 second knockout of the more seasoned yves edwards 34 14 1 though he says the treatment he s received as elitexc s champion from being denied extra event tickets for relatives to getting passed over for marketing opportunities has been less than encouraging in july pro elite presented noons manager dion with the diaz rematch after an in cage tussle at the hawaii event between the two fighters sent interest in the bout skyrocketing
==========================
but good will quickly began to unravel following noons inaugural run in the elitexc cage against charles krazy horse bennett in february 2007 i think the relationship kind of went sour when i fought krazy horse and i lost says noons
==========================
with shaw a family friend and dual promoter noons believes ulterior motives were afoot in the matchmaking process why would you put your friend s son on a main event against someone that you didn t think you could build him up against asks noons despite stopping berto in the third round with a blunt knee noons doubt in pro elite led him and his manager dion to request a non title fight against diaz for their november 2007 encounter in the hopes of hitting the free market afterward on the third and final bout of his contract noons says elitexc was eager to re sign him beforehand but only if he d fight diaz for a newly created 160 pound title
==========================
jeremy lappen elitexc s head of fight operations said last week the promotion was undecided on the promotion s next course of action with its wayward champion noons seems to have already made up his mind though i can guarantee you that for mma i won t be sitting on the sidelines he says
==========================
diaz received 60 000 for his third round bashing of thomas denny on july 26 in stockton calif a lot has changed since noons joined the pro elite stable in early 2007 eighteen months ago noons 7 2 was a hot prospect for the debuting promotion touted by former elitexc live events president gary shaw as a double threat
==========================
it became all about krazy horse which is fine because he won but it was nothing on me noons who was surprisingly knocked out in the first round requested a rematch with the gold toothed bennett but said the promotion turned him down
==========================
but you have to pay for something you want to see noons is not afraid to admit that his compensation was at the root of the breakdown between his reps and pro elite the struggling parent company of elitexc shoxc and a handful of other promotions scattered throughout the world it is about the money and how they were paying somebody i already beat three times more says noons the san diego resident says he s made approximately 83 000 in two years and four fights
==========================
i wanted the diaz fight but it was about little things in the contract at the time says noons

the us is facing similar charges over strikes two days earlier in another border area of afghanistan
==========================
the red cross said 250 people had been killed or wounded in five days of military action and militant attacks in the past week
==========================
two days ago the red cross said that at least 250 afghan civilians had been killed or wounded in insurgent attacks or military action in the previous six days
==========================
he said that those who passed on intelligence to the us military ahead of the air strike should be tried as well as those who carried out the bombing
==========================
at the time the us said that those killed were militants involved in previous mortar attacks on a nato base
==========================
the toll included the us led air strikes and a suicide blast outside the indian embassy in kabul on monday that killed more than 40 people including two indian envoys
==========================
the un said last month that nearly 700 afghan civilians had lost their lives this year about two thirds in militant attacks and about 255 in military operations
==========================
only a few months earlier a nato spokesman said that civilian casualties were the main issue for the nato led force to resolve
==========================
a us air strike killed 47 civilians including 39 women and children as they were travelling to a wedding in afghanistan an official inquiry found today

washington cnn an incident in which u s officials refused to allow a klm royal dutch airlines 747 to fly over the united states has brought to light a potential hole in the nation 's homeland security safety net
==========================
a dutch official told cnn the netherlands will take the matter to the european union in brussels to seek clarification about whether checks of no fly lists are required for flights transiting the united states
==========================
in our interpretation this was not a flight to or from the united states
==========================
koster also expressed irritation about the timing of the incident saying the united states was late in notifying klm that it would not permit the plane to transit
==========================
an official with the department of homeland security said the agency is considering an emergency amendment that would require airlines to check transiting flights ' passenger manifests against the list
==========================
currently the united states requires international airlines to make certain that passengers on flights to and from the united states are not on a list of suspected terrorists
==========================
in the meantime the official said if the united states determines that a flight scheduled to fly over the country is carrying a passenger on the no fly list it will be prohibited from entering u s airspace
==========================
the incident irked klm and dutch officials especially because they said the united states never requested an interview of the two passengers and did not indicate why they were of interest
==========================
but on friday u s authorities denied permission for klm flight 685 to transit u s airspace after hearing indirectly that two passengers on the flight were on the no fly list
==========================
but klm has now begun checking its passenger lists for flights flying over the united states against the u s no fly list to avoid repeating last week 's incident

he told the bbc our investigation found out that 47 civilians were killed by the american bombing and nine others injured

ahmed dehzad one of the province 's parliamentary representatives said that local officials received reports of taliban activity in the vicinity several days before the ceremony but that coalition forces did not issue a warning before the attack on a compound near where the ceremony was held

koizumi has dissolved the japanese diet in response to rejection of postal services commercialization bill

*******************************************************
============================
those ldp members who voted against the postal bill are said to be angry that mr koizumi has called for an election rather than offering his resignation
==========================
the package of six bills proposed that japan post became privatised by 2017 and divided into private companies handling mail delivery banking and insurance
==========================
the move follows the defeat in the upper house of his landmark proposals to reform the country 's postal system
==========================
but the plans had been opposed by many who feared they would lead to a poorer postal services
==========================
japan post is also the biggest buyer of japanese government bonds helping tokyo maintain unusually high levels of public debt
==========================
proponents of the reforms say they are urgently needed to put the postal service 's massive deposits into the hands of private investors and provide an impetus to the economy
==========================
if mr koizumi wins the election he may only lead the party for a year as he has previously said he would step down in september 2006
==========================
in the last lower house elections in november 2003 mr koizumi was returned to power with a reduced majority while the opposition democratic party dpj made gains
==========================
japan post is a huge organisation which has about 25 000 post offices nationwide which all sell the system 's savings and insurance products as well as regular postal services

mr koizumi 's coalition partners and even some within his own party did not want him to call an election for fear they could lose

the western sea border between the two koreas was the scene of deadly naval clashes in 1999 and 2002 and has always been a potential flashpoint

south korea recently deployed its latest high speed guided missile boat along the nll which was drawn by a u s general at the end of the 1950 53 korean war that ended in a truce
==========================
the north korean vessel lost no time to deal a prompt retaliatory blow at the provokers kcna said
