============================
rather than use a first come first served system for domains the registry allows more than one application to be filed per domain name during the application period and an auction takes place for all domain names that receive more than one application
==========================
the relatively low number of sunrise applications indicates a large number of companies may lose their url trademark to cyber squatters or competitors as regular users will be able to snap up domain names
==========================
thousands of domain registrars from around the world are expected to apply for asia domain names within the next couple of weeks
==========================
but during a domain landrush any interested party is able to register a url without restrictions
==========================
domain registrars are getting ready for what they hope is a high demand frantic landrush of domain registrations beginning today as moves toward becoming the internet 's second regional top level domain
==========================
beginning today asia domain names can be registered at the asia registry http www asiaregistry com web site in what icann refers to as a landrush period
==========================
all of our people and systems are in place and we look forward to the commencement of the asia landrush
==========================
prior to the landrush there was a sunrise period during which more than 30 000 early applications were filed by companies and organizations as opposed to individuals
==========================
the first regional tld was the successful eu domain launch that took place in 2006
==========================
according to icann the organization responsible for keeping domain names and ip addresses interoperable more than 70 nations in asia middle east australia or the pacific rim will be eligible to use the asia tld

it has also defined intelligent design the idea that life is too complex to have arisen without the guiding hand of a greater intelligence as a religion along with creationism
==========================
while i am not a believer myself there is no incompatibility between a creator and the evolutionary process it is only when you decide to take a literal interpretation of the creation fable from whichever holy book you have chosen that you have to take the extreme steps of ignoring the evidence and misinterpreting scientific theories and laws

according to the country 's election system a candidate must win at least fifty percent of the popular vote to avoid a run off election

*******************************************************
============================
under afghanistan 's election system a presidential candidate must win over 50 per cent of the vote
==========================
president karzai who was installed as afghanistan s interim president in 2001 and went on to win the country s first ever presidential ballot in 2004 needs to capture more than 50 per cent of the votes to secure an outright first round win and another five years in power
==========================
opinion polls in the run up to last thursday s vote had predicted that mr abdullah had a strong chance of forcing a run off vote
==========================
however some observers say this is almost impossible given that many women were disenfranchised as there were not enough female election staff to carry out the pre vote security checks and that turnout in the south was very low because of the taliban s threat to exact revenge on anyone who voted
==========================
most of the vote rigging claims are concentrated in the southern pashtun belt a must win area for mr karzai where turnout was reported to be as low as 10 percent
==========================
the watchdog s chief grant kippen said reported irregularities included voter intimidation violence ballot box tampering as well as interference by some officials from the independent election commission the body set up to supervise polling
==========================
european union monitors were quick to call the vote good and fair a move criticised by others as premature since election results had yet to be released
==========================
bays said most people are saying that if the election is n't rigged if there is n't fraud then it is likely that there could well be a second round
==========================
just a day earlier abdullah accused karzai of rigging the polls saying that the president uses the state apparatus in order to rig an election

noons won the elitexc lightweight championship on november 10 2007 after the fight was stopped in the first round due to a cut over the eye of then champion nick diaz

*******************************************************
============================
it was either take this fight or nothing noons signed a new agreement in may but a clause was added that forbid the promotion from speaking directly with the fighter regarding negotiations noons impressively defended his title in front of his hometown honolulu crowd last june with a 48 second knockout of the more seasoned yves edwards 34 14 1 though he says the treatment he s received as elitexc s champion from being denied extra event tickets for relatives to getting passed over for marketing opportunities has been less than encouraging in july pro elite presented noons manager dion with the diaz rematch after an in cage tussle at the hawaii event between the two fighters sent interest in the bout skyrocketing
==========================
but now the 25 year old fighter s courage and heart were suddenly thrust into question with the deadline come and gone noons will not be defending his title against diaz on oct 4
==========================
but good will quickly began to unravel following noons inaugural run in the elitexc cage against charles krazy horse bennett in february 2007 i think the relationship kind of went sour when i fought krazy horse and i lost says noons
==========================
diaz received 60 000 for his third round bashing of thomas denny on july 26 in stockton calif a lot has changed since noons joined the pro elite stable in early 2007 eighteen months ago noons 7 2 was a hot prospect for the debuting promotion touted by former elitexc live events president gary shaw as a double threat
==========================
noons tenure with elitexc says the 160 pound champion at least one of those demands found its way into the public forum last week when an elitexc employee reported to the media that noons had been given a 24 hour deadline to accept a rematch with nick diaz for an oct 4 live broadcast on cbs noons and his manager mark dion had been negotiating a new pay scale for the bout for over a month and talks had reached a stalemate
==========================
with shaw a family friend and dual promoter noons believes ulterior motives were afoot in the matchmaking process why would you put your friend s son on a main event against someone that you didn t think you could build him up against asks noons despite stopping berto in the third round with a blunt knee noons doubt in pro elite led him and his manager dion to request a non title fight against diaz for their november 2007 encounter in the hopes of hitting the free market afterward on the third and final bout of his contract noons says elitexc was eager to re sign him beforehand but only if he d fight diaz for a newly created 160 pound title
==========================
jeremy lappen elitexc s head of fight operations said last week the promotion was undecided on the promotion s next course of action with its wayward champion noons seems to have already made up his mind though i can guarantee you that for mma i won t be sitting on the sidelines he says
==========================
berto s father dieusuel fought at ufc 10 while brother andre represented haiti in the 2004 summer olympics
==========================
noons i always wanted diaz
==========================
it became all about krazy horse which is fine because he won but it was nothing on me noons who was surprisingly knocked out in the first round requested a rematch with the gold toothed bennett but said the promotion turned him down

the us is facing similar charges over strikes two days earlier in another border area of afghanistan
==========================
two days ago the red cross said that at least 250 afghan civilians had been killed or wounded in insurgent attacks or military action in the previous six days
==========================
at the time the us said that those killed were militants involved in previous mortar attacks on a nato base
==========================
the red cross said 250 people had been killed or wounded in five days of military action and militant attacks in the past week
==========================
the incident happened in the remote district of deh bala close to the afghan border
==========================
only a few months earlier a nato spokesman said that civilian casualties were the main issue for the nato led force to resolve
==========================
however foreign troops have also often killed civilians leading to an erosion of support for their presence in afghanistan
==========================
the un said last month that nearly 700 afghan civilians had lost their lives this year about two thirds in militant attacks and about 255 in military operations
==========================
the toll included the us led air strikes and a suicide blast outside the indian embassy in kabul on monday that killed more than 40 people including two indian envoys
==========================
the us military initially denied any civilians had been killed

koizumi has dissolved the japanese diet in response to rejection of postal services commercialization bill

*******************************************************
============================
the package of six bills proposed that japan post became privatised by 2017 and divided into private companies handling mail delivery banking and insurance
==========================
japan post is also the biggest buyer of japanese government bonds helping tokyo maintain unusually high levels of public debt
==========================
those ldp members who voted against the postal bill are said to be angry that mr koizumi has called for an election rather than offering his resignation
==========================
the move follows the defeat in the upper house of his landmark proposals to reform the country 's postal system
==========================
japan post is a huge organisation which has about 25 000 post offices nationwide which all sell the system 's savings and insurance products as well as regular postal services
==========================
the postal reform would have transformed japan post with its 3 trillion assets into the world 's largest bank
==========================
proponents of the reforms say they are urgently needed to put the postal service 's massive deposits into the hands of private investors and provide an impetus to the economy
==========================
the rejection is a major blow to japan 's future and its economy said economy minister heizo takenaka the main architect of the reform
==========================
the defeat of the postal reform bill by 125 votes to 108 has also revealed deep divisions within the ruling ldp with 22 members voting against the measure
